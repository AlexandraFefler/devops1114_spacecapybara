# devops1114-spacecapybara
A rolling DevOps project for practicing tools and approaches during my studies at Sela College. 
Basically a sandbox to duck around in before the real course final project 
(I've started this waaaay too late fml)

The project includes: flask app.py, Dockerization, docker-compose including a mysql db initialization, terraform cd to an aws ec2, terraform provision for a whole gke and cd of the app to it, and prometheus monitoring /metrics and config .yaml file for it 
 
(There maaay be a problem with terraform now cuz I accidentally uploaded the terraform.lock.hcl thatever it exactly does so I might wanna fix it but I also might just not care cuz no use for me anymore I hope)
