# devops1114-spacecapybara
A rolling DevOps project for practicing tools and approaches during my studies at Sela College. 
Basically a sandbox to duck around in before the real course final project 
(I've started this waaaay too late fml)

The project includes: flask app.py, Dockerization, docker-compose including a mysql db initialization, terraform cd to an aws ec2, terraform provision for a whole gke and cd of the app to it, and prometheus monitoring /metrics and config .yaml file for it
